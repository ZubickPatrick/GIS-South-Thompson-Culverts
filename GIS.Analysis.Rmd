## here we will acquire the basemaps and CU boundary shapefiles for the GIS work we are doing with Simon.

## first need to get my packages of interest and most use

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(raster)
library(RCurl)
library(sf)

# dont think I will need more packages but can add more if need be

```

```{r}

# URL of the basemap shapefile
url <- "https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub/nrcan_rncan/vector/framework_cadre/Atlas_of_Canada_15M/"

# Download the shapefile from the URL
temp_file <- tempfile()
download.file(url, temp_file)

# Read the shapefile into R using sf
bc_basemap <- st_read(temp_file)


bc_basemap <- raster("path/to/basemap/image.tif")

# Plot the map
plot(bc_basemap)


# Load the basemap image
bc_basemap <- raster("path/to/basemap/image.tif")

# Plot the map
plot(bc_basemap)




```
