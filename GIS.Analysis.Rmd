## here we will acquire the basemaps and CU boundary shapefiles for the GIS work we are doing with Simon.

## first need to get my packages of interest and most use

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(raster)
library(RCurl)
library(sf)
library(maps) 
library(mapdata)
library(maptools)
library(rgeos)
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsn)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# dont think I will need more packages but can add more if need be

```

```{r}

# can i visualize the chinook shapefile

# Read in the shapefile
shapefile <- st_read("CK_CU_BOUNDARY_En.shp")


```
